\arguments{
\item{rca.obj}{RCA object.}

\item{logFoldChange}{Log fold change required to call gene DE.}

\item{method}{Denotes which test to use. Available options are:
\itemize{
 \item{"wilcox"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
 groups of cells using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (default)
 \item{"bimod"} : Likelihood-ratio test for single cell gene expression,
 (McDavid et al., Bioinformatics, 2013)
 \item{"roc"} : Identifies 'markers' of gene expression using ROC analysis.
 For each gene, evaluates (using AUC) a classifier built on that gene alone,
 to classify between two groups of cells. An AUC value of 1 means that
 expression values for this gene alone can perfectly classify the two
 groupings (i.e. Each of the cells in cells.1 exhibit a higher level than
 each of the cells in cells.2). An AUC value of 0 also means there is perfect
 classification, but in the other direction. A value of 0.5 implies that
 the gene has no predictive power to classify the two groups. Returns a
 'predictive power' (abs(AUC-0.5) * 2) ranked matrix of putative differentially
 expressed genes.
 \item{"t"} : Identify differentially expressed genes between two groups of
 cells using the Student's t-test.
 }}

\item{mean.Exp}{Minimum mean expression of a gene to be considered in the DE gene calculation}

\item{deepsplit}{If hclust was used for clustering, the desired deepsplit can be specified here.. Values can range from 0 to 4. Default is 1.}

\item{min.pct}{only test genes that are detected in a minimum fraction of
min.pct cells in either of the two populations. Meant to speed up the function
by not testing genes that are very infrequently expressed. Default is 0.25}

\item{min.diff.pct}{only test genes that show a minimum difference in the
fraction of detection between the two groups. Set to -Inf by default}

\item{random.seed}{Random seed for downsampling. default is 1}

\item{min.cells.group}{Minimum number of cells in one of the groups}

\item{pseudocount.use}{Pseudocount to add to averaged expression values when calculating logFC. 1 by default.}

\item{p.adjust.methods}{correction method for calculating qvalue. default is BH (or FDR)}

\item{top.genes.per.cluster}{Number of top DE genes to be considered per cluster}

\item{pairwise}{Flag indicating whether DE genes should be compared derived in pairwise manner or 1 cluster vs all others (Default).}
